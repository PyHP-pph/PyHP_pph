# PyHP-PPH.py

A CIC for the [PyHP++# programming language](https://github.com/PyHP-pph/PyHP-pph) written in Python 3.

The spec for the language is in its infancy, so many things are assumed. It should not be used for serious work until the spec is complete, as many of the assumptions made could be different in a future specification, and the assumption will be removed and replaced. As a matter of fact, you shouldn't use this for serious work anyway. This language is too smart for you.

Although contributions to PyHP-PPH.py are appreciated, it'd be preferred if you instead contribute to the missing parts of the PyHP++# specifications.
